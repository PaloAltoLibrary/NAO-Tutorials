## About NAO

Nao (pronounced now) is an autonomous, programmable humanoid robot developed by Aldebaran Robotics. Aldebaran Roboticswas acquired by Japan's SoftBank Mobile in 2013.

Nao robots have been used for research and education purposes in numerous academic institutions worldwide.

This tutorial is based on NAO version 5.

## Operation System and Programming Language

Threre are different tools for different levels of users. The tutorials in this repository will mainly forcus on [Non-developers](#Non-developers) and [Beginner developers](#Beginner-developers).

### Non-developers

For non-developers there is the Integrated Development Environment (IDE) Choreographe. It’s a desktop application that allows you to control Nao using a simple drag and drop interface, including:

* Create animations, behaviors and dialogs
* Test them on a simulated robot or directly on a real one
* Monitor and control your robot

### Beginner developers

People with rudimentary programming skills can write Python code and add it to Choreographe. 

### Expert developers

Expert developers can choose from - C++, Python, MatLab and many more through their SDK’s.
